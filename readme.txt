didlist.owl and didlist_0.owl are abandonned.Because they utilize too fine-grained conceptulization that we have to build too much individuals which are not necessary.
The basic idea in detergent.owl and didlist_0.owl is try to hold functional unit and value seperated in order to conserve a maximized modularization, while, this design will introduce much more work in the modeling process.



lesson learned: try to keep the ObjectProperty hierarchy and definition simple, otherwise the reasoner's burden could be too much,whcih would be hard for the explanation search.
